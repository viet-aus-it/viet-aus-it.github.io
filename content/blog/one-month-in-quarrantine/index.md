After one month in quarrantine, situations are now being relaxed.
During that one month, we have been doing a lot of technical 101
talks. 10, to be exact. Our deepest thanks go to our speakers:

- **Trung Ly** [(@exNewbie)](https://github.com/exNewbie) for his talk on AWS
  LightSail, a cheap way to get started on AWS.
- **Cuong Do** [(@dohaicuong)](https://github.com/dohaicuong) for his talk on
  GraphQL 101, and how to replace REST APIs with GraphQL to reduce
  "endpoint spaghetti".
- **Andy Truong** [(@andytruong)](https://github.com/andytruong) for his ideas
  about implementing microservices architecture and all of its troubles.
- **Sam Huynh** [(@samhwang)](https://github.com/samhwang) for an introduction
  on Docker and Docker-Compose, and also on getting started with CI/CD
  with GitHub Actions.
- **Paul Nguyen** [(@punkupoz)](https://github.com/punkupoz) for an introduction
  to container orchestration with Kubernetes.
- **Luan Nguyen** [(@tklarryonline)](https://github.com/tklarryonline) for an
  in-depth overview of UX/UI Design in Agile projects.
- **Van Hoang** [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/van-hoang-cam/),
  who brought us inside the minds of a recruiter in the tech world.
- **Toan Ha** [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamanhtritoan/),
  with his brief description on what Business Analysis actually is, and
  what should be involved.
- Last and not least, we have **Khiem Nguyen**
  [(LinkedIn)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenthanhkhiemvn/)
  shed light to us on his journey transitioning from a Developer to
  a Businessman.

We hope that everyone had been learning something new. Not just from
the talks, but also on your own as well. Keep on learning, and keep on
keeping on.
